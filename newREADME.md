## ðŸš€ Branch Strategy

We use a branching strategy to ensure clean development, testing, and production workflows:

| Branch        | Purpose                                  | Environment             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `master`      | Live production code                     | `www.landc.co.uk`       |
| `testing`     | Final pre-release branch (client review) | _Shared privately_      |
| `development` | Integration branch for new work          | `dev.landc.co.uk`       |
| `feature/*`   | Individual developer branches            | Localhost (`localhost`) |
